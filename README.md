## Project Introduction

This is a Kaggle-sourced dataset used to refine my data analytics skills further and gain more data science experience. The “Customer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset” contains a variety of intricate insights into customer preferences and mannerisms when shopping from an untitled online retailer.

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to be part of an ongoing process to refine and develop my data analysis skills. In this customer analysis, I will discover new insights within the data I find interesting and useful with the intention of finding new methods to optimize business performance and growth. Key areas of focus include finding our primary customer demographic, their demand preferences for our products, and new opportunities to grow the business.

## Analysis Outline

Before looking at the dataset, there were several interesting questions I wanted to learn more about. Below are the insights I am interested in exploring more:

1. Identifying our customers

- 1.1 Who is our main customer demographic? Where are they from?
   
- 1.2 Which products do customers love the most? Size? Color?
   
- 1.3 What is the customer sentiment about the business?
   
- 1.4 What are the customer's preferred methods of transaction?
   
2. Business performance and trends
   
- 2.1 What are the best-selling products?
  
- 2.2 What is our customer retention?
  
- 2.3 Does subscription status increase sales?
  
- 2.4 Does having discounts increase sales?
  
- 2.5 What time of the year is the busiest?

## Executive Summary

### Conclusion

This apparel business primarily caters to men’s fashion with their customer demographic being mostly middle-aged men being about 44 years old. This demographic typically has more disposable income to spend on consumer-discretionary products which is the ideal customer for this apparel brand. This customer base also generally has a positive opinion of this retailer's products shown by their higher retention rates and independent choice of opting for a premium shipping method to receive their packages quicker. This business is currently in the growth phase of its business cycle and should continue to find new ways to cut costs and grow company revenue. Potential new growth avenues include working with other large online payment services to make online shopping more easily accessible to new customers and improve the quality of their basic product lines to ensure stable annual cash flow. Cost-cutting ideas could include cutting subscription services and limiting promos and discounts to large annual events rather than a consistent offering.

### Key Findings

- This is a fashion apparel business that primarily caters to men and male fashion trends. 

- The customer demographic is older adults that age ranges from 31-57 years old with the average customer age being about 44 years old. 

- Existing customers generally hold a positive view of the products they purchase since many of them consistently pay for a premium shipping option to get their orders faster. 

- Most customers are returning customers showing high customer retention, half of the existing customers have already made over 25+ purchases and counting. 

- Customers typically pay with a payment service or with their credit/debit card. If this business can widen the payment services, they accept and make the payment process easier for first-time customers then they can expand their apparel products to new customers in new markets.

- This is a smaller business that is still in the growth phase of the business cycle and should primarily focus on increasing revenue.

- To make revenue annually more consistent the business needs to improve more on their basic items like shirts, jeans, shorts, etc. since those are the most bought products that customers will return yearly for.

    - These products should primarily be sold in neutral or earth-tone colors since those are the most versatile and timeless colors that will always be sought after by customers. 

-  There needs to be a conversation about keeping the subscription service since it does not generate any meaningful additional revenue. 

    - Either cut the subscription service or allocate more resources to it to increase customer satisfaction in hopes of increasing revenue.

- Discounts and promos should be reserved for special events only since customer retention is already so high most customers would purchase their desired apparel products regardless of a discount code. Having a discount code at this point in the business cycle is only limiting the total amount of revenue to be gained. 

    - One recommendation is to save all the unsold or overstocked products for summer since that is the slowest season.
