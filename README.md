### Project Introduction: 

This is a Kaggle-sourced dataset used to refine my data analytics skills further and gain more data science experience. The Customer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset contains a variety of intricate insights into customer preferences and mannerisms when shopping from this untitled online source. Throughout the project, I will discover and answer insights within the data I find interesting and useful to optimize business performance and growth.


#### Analysis Outline: 

Before looking at the dataset, there were several interesting questions I wanted to learn more about. Below are the insights I am interested in exploring more:

1. Identifying our customers

- 1.1 Who is our main customer demographic? Where are they from?
   
- 1.2 Which products do customers love the most? Size? Color?
   
- 1.3 What is the customer sentiment about the business?
   
- 1.4 What are the customer's preferred methods of transaction?
   
2. Business performance and trends
   
- 2.1 What are the best-selling products?
  
- 2.2 What is our customer retention?
  
- 2.3 Does subscription status increase sales?
  
- 2.4 Does having discounts increase sales?
  
- 2.5 What time of the year is the busiest?


#### Results:

-	Discovered the primary customer demographic, their age, and where they are located

-	Confidently gauged and analyzed customer sentiment towards their products

-	Made suggestions on how to grow the customer base to new customers

-	Revealed new areas of improvement to increase product quality and increase customer satisfaction

-	Brought light on business practices that could be improved upon or removed to lower costs and increase revenue
