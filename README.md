## Project Introduction

This is a Kaggle-sourced dataset used to refine my data analytics skills further and gain more data science experience. The marketing team from a clothing apparel business is asking for recommendations on current customer behavior, improving the business processes, and growing the customer base. In this analysis, I will analyze the shopping behavior dataset to answer the marketing team's inquiries and make recommendations for areas of improvement.

    1.2 Which states contain the largest population of customers?
    
    1.3 Which states contain the largest population for the target demographic for each gender?

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

- The current primary customer demographic is male customers from all age ranges which consists of about 68% of total customers

- Female customers consist of about 32% of total customers and the largest cohort of female customers are from 45-50 years old

- The largest number of customers are from the West Coast and the Midwest consisting of Montana, Illinois, California, and Idaho 

- The primary revenue stream stems from clothes and accessories products

- Popular products among both genders are jewelry, shirts, and dresses in medium and large sizes with earth tone and cool tone color pallets

- The fall season is the busiest season due to consumers cyclical holiday shopping season

- Customer sentiment is generally positive from customer purchases across all demographics


### Reccomendations

- The marketing team should focus on increasing the customer count from the current top states since this business is still in the growing phase of the business cycle. Specifically, California and New York should be the primary markets to target since those are the largest markets compared to the other top states.

- The marketing team should provide two different marketing campaigns based on gender preferences in certain states to maximize ad effectiveness

- Ads should primarily be displaying clothing and accessory products with earth and cool tone aesthetics since those are the most popular products

- The marketing budget should be heavily allocated to the fall since that is the start of the holiday shopping season. In addition, this is also the opportune time to advertise products since the most popular color palettes are earth and cool-tone colors, which fit the season aesthetically.

- Customer surveys should be handed out more often to more accurately gauge customer sentiment and improve customer experience with the business and its products, specifically to male customers who shopped in the springtime.

- Currently, accepted payment services are Venmo and PayPal, if payment services can expand to other popular payment services like Cash App, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Amazon Pay, then new customers are more likely to shop at this business due to increased customer convenience
