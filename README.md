Objective: 

The project objective is to identify the customer demographic, review business performance, and find hidden trends within the data.

Project Introduction: 

This is a Kaggle-sourced dataset used to further refine my data analytics skills and gain more experience in the data science field.  The Customer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset contains a variety of intricate insights into customer preferences and mannerisms when shopping from this untitled online source. Throughout the project, I will discover and answer insights within the data that I find interesting and useful to optimize business performance and growth. Below is the link to the original dataset.

  1.2 Which products do customers love the most? Size? Color?
   
  1.3 What is the customer sentiment about the business?
   
  1.4 What are the customer's prefered method of transaction?
   
2. Business performance and trends
   
  2.1 What are the best selling products?
  
  2.2 What is our customer retention?
  
  2.3 Does subscription status increase sales?
  
  2.4 Does having discounts increase sales?
  
  2.5 What time of the year is the busiest?
